# Maze-Generator-and-Solver
This fun code written for the purpose of practicing recursion first generates a 2D maze of a given width and height with CLI visualisation and then recursively finds the path through it from the starting point to the end, again with CLI visualisation.

The main Python file is **maze_visual.py**. When running it, the user is given an option to set the desired width and height of the randomly generated maze (recomended figures for the start are "40, 25"). The program then generates the maze and solves it, if it is solvable.

Or the user can input a maze already created earlier and then the program just solves it.

All the randomly generated mazes are stored in **maze_container.txt** file from which they can be retrieved and reused.

### Have fun!!
